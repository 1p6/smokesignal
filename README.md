Scale your real-time app with p2p message passing.

Broadcast events or just speak to a specific peer.  
Autonomic: Have your nodes gather and reorder automatically.  
Configurable: If you provide your node with a network entry point, it'll join some peers automatically. Alternatively you can simply connect manually.  
Self-healing: Auto-detection of netsplits and disconnect events.

Stay tuned for some serious awesomeness...
